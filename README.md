## 📋 About

The program is widely used by developers, translators, and enthusiasts to customize the appearance and behavior of applications. It allows you to look "inside" an executable file and modify what is usually hidden from view.

### ✨ Features

*   View Resources — a convenient tree view of the file structure: icons, cursors, menus, dialog boxes, string tables, version information, and much more.
*   Extract Resources — save any resources to disk as separate files (images, scripts, binary data).
*   Edit and Replace — modify text in dialogs and menus, replace icons and images with your own.
*   Add New Resources — embed new elements into a file, for example, to support additional interface languages.
*   Script Support — built-in resource compiler and decompiler for working with .rc files.
*   Command Line — full support for automating operations via CLI for batch processing files.
*   32/64-bit Support — correctly handles modern applications.

## 🚀 Usage

*   Localization (translation) of programs into other languages.
